    "# Portland OpenStreetMap Analysis\n",

    "The area I chose to explore is Portland, Oregon in United States. Dataset can be found [here](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/portland_oregon/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Portland, Oregon’s largest city, sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers, in the shadow of snow-capped Mount Hood. It’s known for its parks, bridges and bicycle paths, as well as for its eco-friendliness and its microbreweries and coffeehouses. The reason I chose Portland to explore is because I've visited once before and would like to live there one day. It is a lovely city with unique neighborhoods and this project presented an opportunity to explore it further."

    "# Problems Encountered: Auditing & Cleaning process\n",
    "\n",
    "To familiarize myself with the dataset, I first took a sample of the XML data and explored its main components: nodes, ways, and tags. As OSM is an open-source, volunteer-created project, it is especially prone to having \"dirty\" data. Before proceeding with data analysis, it'd be helpful to iteratively audit and clean the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Better street types\n",
    "When traveling in Portland, I remember noticing unique street names. Thinking that there may be more incorrectly recorded street types than other cities, I decided to audit the street types. After writing validation rules and programatically checking the data, I encountered the following main problems with street types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- over-abbreviated street type (e.g. Rd)\n",
    "- lowercase street type (e.g. street)\n",
    "\n",
    "To standardize the street names, I corrected the above street types using the following update_name function and mapping variable which specifies what the new name should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def update_name(name, mapping):\n",
    "    #initialize m and search through argument name using regex\n",
    "    m = street_type_re.search(name)\n",
    "    if m:\n",
    "        street_type = m.group()\n",
    "        #if street_type is in mapping, then substituate the value\n",
    "        if street_type in mapping.keys():\n",
    "            name = re.sub(street_type, mapping[street_type], name)\n",
    "    return name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Better postcodes\n",
    "After testing and confirming the street names were corrected, I took a look at postcodes. In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4. Though it is not widely used, some postcodes continue to use these 4-digit extensions. During the audit, I encountered the following main problems with postodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- postcodes with 4-digit extensions (e.g. '98683-8934')\n",
    "- postcodes with leading characters (e.g. 'Portland, OR 97209')\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow for more consistent queries, I used the following update_postcode function to drop the characters before/after the 5-digit postcodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def update_postcode(postcode):\n",
    "    search = re.match(r'^\\D*(\\d{5}).*', postcode)\n",
    "    # select group that is captured\n",
    "    \n",
    "    clean_postcode = search.group(1)\n",
    "    return clean_postcode\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the street types and postal codes were cleaned, data was prepared to be inserted into a SQL database. The elements in OSM XML file were parsed and transformed to tabular format, making it possible to write to .csv files. These .csv files were then imported to a SQL database as tables and readied for analysis!"

    "# Additional Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "As the metro extract is inclusive of the surrounding areas of Portland, one way we can improve the data is filtering out these areas before analysis. One benefit would be access to a more accurate depiction of Portland. For example, for Portland specific questions such as \"how many coffeeshops are in Portland?\" we won't be reporting inflated numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the improvement, the challenge would be defining where Portland's boundary actually lies. We can use the zipcodes to specify the areas that fall within city of Portland and remove the rest from the dataset. Zipcodes in Portland start with digits '972', so it would be less complex to isolate than other areas."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Portland's OSM data is in good quality, we can make additional edits to improve the map. One way is to use a more powerful bot that can programmatically edit and help standardize the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested earlier, the top contributing users may already be bot developers (given the skewed contributor distribution). If these users can share best practices to edit or utilize the same bot, this would also standardize the editing practices, resulting in a better OSM of Portland for everyone."
